# Software Technical Documentation

Software technical documentation is a comprehensive set of documents that provide detailed information about a software product or system.

## Introduction

Software technical documentation is a comprehensive set of documents that provide detailed information about a software product or system. Different types of documents are created throughout the software development lifecycle. Documentation is important as it serves as a reference for developers, users and other stakeholders involved in the software development process. Documentation exists to explain product functionality, unify project-related information, and ensure common understanding between the different stakeholders in a software project.

## Scopes and objectives

The main objectives of having comprehensive technical software documentation are:

- **Facilitating common understanding:** Documentation provides comprehensive information about the software's functionality, design & architecture, maintenance and usage. It helps different stakeholders such as users, business analysts, developers, users, and other stakeholders to have a common understanding of the software development process.

- **Supports development:** Technical documentation serves as a guide for developers during the software development process. It provides information on user requirements, design decisions, coding standards, and implementation details which are crucial for maintaining consistency and quality across the codebase.

- **Aids in maintenance and updates:** Detailed technical documentation facilitates effective maintenance as it outlines existing features, code structure and configurations. It facilitates troubleshooting, bug fixing and adding new features by providing information on the software's design and architecture.

- **Enhances collaboration:** Documentation plays a crucial role in providing evidence of compliance with policies, regulations and guidelines, taking into consideration the implementation and maintenance of software. It can include evidence documentation covering standards and procedures.

- **Onboarding new team members:** Technical documentation is invaluable for onboarding new team members. It provides the essential information on the project about information and resources to quickly get up to speed with the project, which can reduce the learning curve.

- **Supports user training and adoption:** For end users, documentation helps them learn how to use the software effectively, leading to better adoption and satisfaction.

- **Reduces support burden:** Well-documented software reduces the need for extensive customer support by enabling users to troubleshoot issues independently. Detailed troubleshooting guides and FAQs can address commonly encountered problems.

- **Ensures compliance and accountability:** Documentation plays a crucial role in providing evidence of compliance with policies, regulations and guidelines, taking into consideration the implementation and maintenance of software. It can include evidence of compliance with quality assurance, implementing security measures, testing and validation processes, among others.

## Process Documentation

Process documentation describes the course of the software project, from creation to the end of software maintenance. It serves as an authoritative guide to the development of the system and ensures that internal knowledge is retained. The goal of process documentation is to structure and organize the software development efforts better, making them easier to understand and execute. It helps to make the project more transparent and reduce the workroom due effort. Click to view the details of the types of process documentation.

### Progress Reports (Mandatory)

A project status or progress report is a document that describes the progress of a project within a specific period and compared against the project plan. Project managers use status reports to keep stakeholders informed of progress and monitor costs, risks, time and work.

- The work that's been completed
- The summary of the project budget and schedule
- A list of action items
- Any issues and risks, and what's being done about them

Frequency may vary, but for most projects weekly and monthly progress reports are submitted to different stakeholders. Progress reports can be documented and tracked using a suitable tool.

### Change Control Documents (Mandatory)
A software change request document is required when a change needs to be made to a system. It should include:

- Requester information (person/department)  
- Nature and rationale of the change  
- Impact on other parts of the system  

---

### Software Support Issue Logs and Reports (Mandatory)
Support issue logs track raised requests and include:

- Requester details  
- Date raised  
- Issue details & analysis  
- Classification (based on impact)  
- Resolution status (open/closed)  

Support reports summarize these issues for effectiveness review.

## Product Documentation

Product documentation describes the software product to be developed and is aimed at different audiences namely: analysts, developers, testers, users, business and maintenance teams. The main product documentation that should be produced in a project are detailed below.

### 1. Software Requirements Document (Mandatory)

A software requirements document provides information about the required system functionality based on the needs of the stakeholders. Requirements are statements of what should be done. They include business requirements stating the high level business needs to support the project along with the features and functions defining the features and functions to support the business needs. Non-functional requirements defining the features non- product requirements such as usability, performance and security.

---

### Design Documentation (Mandatory)
Covers **how** the product is built, including:

- **Architecture & design principles** (e.g., microservices).  
- **Solution design details**: system architecture, UI design, integration design, database design.  
- **Diagrammatic representations**.  

---

### API Documentation (Mandatory)
Contains instructions on using/integrating APIs, including:

- Functions, classes, return types, arguments  
- Tutorials and examples  
- Automated documentation tools recommended  

---

### Test Documentation (Mandatory)
Includes:  

- **Test Strategy**: overall testing approach, team structure, priorities, and methodologies (functional, performance, security).  
- **Test Plan**: what should be tested in a sprint (features, methods, timeframes, roles).  
- **Test Cases**: detailed actions and expected results.  
- **Test Reports**: pass/fail results and identified issues.  

---

### Data Migration Documentation (Mandatory)
Required when migrating data from legacy/manual systems.  

- **Data Migration Strategy**: scope, datasets, approach, cleansing/conversion methods.  
- **Data Migration Reports**: record of test cycles, issues, and final production migration.  

---

### User Documentation (Mandatory)
Created for end-users in simple language.  

Forms:  
- Printed manuals  
- Online knowledge bases  
- FAQs, tutorials, video guides  
- Embedded assistance and support portals  

---

### Software Configuration & Maintenance Documentation (Mandatory)
Captures information for effective software maintenance:  

- **System Overview**  
- **Configuration Items**  
- **Configuration Management Plan**  
- **Configuration Settings**  
- **Installation Instructions**  
- **Integration & Interoperability**  
- **Performance & Scalability**  
- **Security Considerations**  
- **Testing & Validation**  
- **Documentation & Support**

## Project Plans and Schedules

Project plans and schedules are usually created before the project starts and are continuously updated during the software development process. A project plan defines the project's scope, schedule, deliverables, milestones and tasks and may take different forms depending on the implementation methodology used.

Where a waterfall methodology is used the plan may include a detailed work breakdown structure that lists all the activities, tasks the project. These are documented as tasks and activities that need to be performed to the agile approach which is the most methodology used in software projects in Government institutions, planning happens iteratively, including team product roadmaps, project backlog, release plans and sprint plans.
