# Software Lifecycle Management
---

The purpose of these guidelines is to define and standardize the process for acquiring, implementing, and maintaining software in Government institutions in Rwanda. They provide leading practices for managing software at each stage of the software lifecycle with the objective of reducing software implementation risks leading to successful software projects.

---

## Scopes and objectives

They are mandatory and applicable to all Government institutions in Rwanda and should be followed by Government staff as well as any external parties involved in the acquisition, implementation and maintenance of software within Government institutions. Key objectives of these guidelines include:

- Ensure software projects implemented in Government institutions are initiated and acquired in line with existing policies.
- Minimise duplication in acquisition and implementation of software projects across governments and ensure efficient sharing of resources wherever possible.
- Ensure software projects are implemented in line with best practices to ensure quality and ease of maintenance.
- Ensure software projects meet the needs and requirements of institutions and deliver value.
- Ensure software projects meet data protection and privacy regulations and requirements.
- To secure the integrity and availability of government software and protect the institution from malicious attacks.

## Overview

Software Lifecycle Management refers to a structured process acquiring, implementing and maintaining high quality software. Government institutions should follow the following steps when deploying new software:

1. Concept note/feasibility study
2. Requirements Analysis and Terms of Reference
3. Software acquisition
   - External Procurement
   - Inhouse Development
4. Architecture & Design
5. Development
6. Testing
7. Deployment
8. Operations & Maintenance
9. Upgrading and Decommissioning

**Agile approach [Recommended]**

## Architecture and Design

The Architecture and Design phase involves transforming the software specifications into a technical design. This phase involves designing the software architecture, user interface, the database and integration interfaces. The activities to be carried out in this phase include:

- **Requirements validation (Mandatory)** – Software requirements and specifications should be validated to ensure that they are clear and understood prior to design.
- **Software architecture design (Mandatory)** – Defining the software architecture by identifying the components of the system, their relationships, and how they interact with each other.
- **UI/UX Design (Mandatory)** – Design the user interface by defining the look and feel of the system, as well as the way that users input data and interact with the system. Refer to RISA UI/UX and accessibility guidelines.
- **Database Design (Mandatory)** – Designing the database by defining the structure of the data, as well as the way that data is stored and retrieved.
- **Integration design (Mandatory)** – Design any required integration interfaces based on the approach or standards agreed.
- **Design review (Mandatory)** – Perform a design review, which includes technical reviews of application and infrastructure, as well as a review of high-level processes.
- **Design of training (Mandatory)** – Design initial end-user training and awareness programs.
- **Infrastructure Design (Mandatory)** – Design the infrastructure required including establishing separate development, test and production environments.

> **Output:** System Architecture Document, User Interface (UI) Design, Integration Design, Database Design

## Development

The Development phase involves the process of transforming the design into a working software system. This phase involves coding the software, unit testing it, and integrating it with other components of the system. Institutions should refer to RISA guidelines for web and mobile applications development. Key guidelines include:

- **Clear understanding of requirements and design (Mandatory)** – Developers should ensure clear understanding of the requirements and design with frequent engagement with stakeholders including Project managers, business analysts and users.
- **Version Control (Mandatory)** – Utilize version control systems such as Git to manage source code efficiently. This enables collaboration among developers, facilitates tracking changes, and provides a backup of the codebase.
- **Automated Testing (Recommended)** – Implement automated testing where possible for unit, integration, and regression testing. This ensures code quality, detects bugs early, and facilitates continuous integration and delivery.
- **Code Review (Recommended)** – Conduct regular code reviews to ensure code quality, adherence to coding standards, and knowledge sharing among team members. Code reviews also help identify potential issues and promote better design practices.
